## Description

Democamp is a partial clone of Basecamp, an application for project management. The website has login and signup pages which allows the user to create an account or sign in. The user can try a demo login to test out our features if the user does not want to sign up for an account. There is a navigation bar at the top of the site to allow users to navigate through helpful options. Once users are logged in to Democamp they are redirected to the user dashboard. The user dashboard lists all project titles and descriptions that users have created. Each projects index page shows the cards for the todos, messages, and schedule components. Each components page shows the details for that component.

## Framework

Democamp is a full stack web application.
* Backend framework: Ruby on Rails. Allows for increased scalability and efficiency, for example, by avoiding N+1 queries. 
* Frontend framework: Redux and React (store and components). Creates a dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly single-page web application. 
* Relational database management system: PostgresSQL. Ensures an object-oriented database that is both highly compatable and capable. 
* Container-based cloud platform: Heroku Server. Hosts our database and file repository via syncing our github applicaton repository. 
* Project/module bundler: Webpack. Used to ensure all JavaScript depenencies are managed correctly.
